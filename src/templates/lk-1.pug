                strong What is the biggest difference between keeping my wealth in stocks/government currency vs cryptocurrency?
              p.
                The biggest difference between crypto and stocks/fiat currency is that supply canâ€™t be diluted in crypto like it can and does get diluted with the others from the supply getting increased. Example If there is only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins the supply goes down as they are lost by individuals and corporations. That results in fewer and fewer bitcoins for all the people that want to use it as it becomes 
                more successful. 
                Even with bitcoin going to the 8th decimal there is never going to be enough for everyone on earth to own a large amount of them.
