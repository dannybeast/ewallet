              <h3>5. THE WALLET</h3>
            </div>
            <p>5.1 Description</p>
            <p>5.1.1 The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by Blockchain Luxembourg S.A. At no point will Blockchain ever take custody of Virtual Currency stored in a Wallet. The Wallet is only capable of supporting certain Virtual Currencies. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store Virtual Currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.</p>
            <p>5.1.2 When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access Virtual Currency previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf.</p>
            <p>5.2 Risk Disclosures Relating to the Wallet.</p>
            <p>5.2.1 In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Blockchain.</p>
            <p>5.2.2 Blockchain has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the relevant Virtual Currency network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the transaction. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in any Virtual Currency or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.</p>
            <p>5.2.3 Once transaction details have been submitted to a Virtual Currency network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Blockchain has no control over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</p>
            <p>5.3 Forks. In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, Blockchain may not be able to support activity related to your Virtual Currency. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Blockchain is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network disruption.</p>
            <p>5.4 No Password Retrieval.</p>
            <p>5.4.1 With respect to the Wallet, Blockchain does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor any keys, network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet password retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet password. Any Virtual Currency you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret your Wallet password. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of Virtual Currency in your Wallet</p>
            <p>5.4.2 When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep secret all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>5.5 Fees. Blockchain does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling Virtual Currency. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation “miner’s fees”) required to use a Virtual Currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and Blockchain shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.</p>
            <div class="text-title">
              <h3>6. SWAP</h3>
            </div>
            <p>6.1 Description. We may provide Swap to you using the Wallet interface. Swap is provided to you exclusively by Blockchain Access UK LTD or a Third Party Conversion Service. Through Swap, Blockchain shall display to you a conversion rate that may include a fee, which you agree to pay. Swap works in connection with the Wallet, by which we shall deliver to you the requested Virtual Currency, less any applicable fees, by executing a transaction from a Virtual Currency address we control to one associated with your Wallet.</p>
            <p>6.2 Due Diligence. We may, at our sole discretion and from time-to-time, require you to satisfy our Compliance Program before participating in Swap or receiving funds. In order to use Swap, you agree to cooperate with any such request and pay any associated fees, which may be modified or supplemented at any time.</p>
            <p>6.3 No Cancellation. You may not cancel, reverse or change any Swap transaction. We may suspend, delay, redirect, reverse or cancel any Swap transaction at any time and for any reason. For example, and without limitation, we may do so if we suspect any risk of fraud, crime, breach of this User Agreement, or illicit activity.</p>
            <p>6.4 Transaction Limitation. We may implement Swap transaction limits. These may vary based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the time of your transaction, your location, the Virtual Currency purchased, and the Virtual Currency sold. We implement, raise and lower Swap transaction limits in our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>6.5 Third Party Conversion Service. On occasion, a third party service provider, selected by Blockchain in our sole discretion, may operate Swap. YOUR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CONVERSION SERVICE FOR SWAP SHALL BE ON AN ‘AS-IS’ BASIS. Blockchain is not your counterparty in any transaction completed via any Third Party Conversion Service and cannot be held liable for any loss caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by your use of the Third Party Conversion Service.</p>
            <div class="text-title">
              <h3>7. LOCKBOX</h3>
            </div>
            <p>7.1 Description. We may advertise to you a Blockchain Lockbox hardware device to be used in connection with the Wallet or other Services. A Lockbox is manufactured, offered, sold and supported (if applicable) by third parties, not Blockchain. You have no relationship, contractual or otherwise, with Blockchain in connection with your purchase of a Lockbox from such third party. We do not act as a reseller. We may, from time-to-time, include features permitting you to use a Lockbox in connection with the Wallet. We do not guarantee support for, or access to, any Lockbox as part of the Services. We shall not be responsible for any damages caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Lockbox or any use of a Lockbox, whether or not it was used in connection with the Services.</p>
            <p>7.2 No Password Retrieval.</p>
            <p>7.2.1 Blockchain does not receive or store passwords, keys, network addresses, transaction history, personal identification numbers (“PINs”) or other credentials associated with a Lockbox. We cannot assist you with Lockbox credential retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret any Lockbox credentials. Any Virtual Currency you have associated with a Lockbox may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret your credentials. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase or PIN) can dispose of Virtual Currency in your Lockbox.</p>
            <p>7.2.2 When you set up a Lockbox, you must: (a) create strong credentials (like PINs) that you do not use for any other service; (b) protect and keep secret all credentials; (c) protect access to your Lockbox; (d) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Lockbox; and (e) use the backup functionality provided with the Lockbox, keeping all backup information secure and confidential. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur in connection with your Lockbox and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Lockbox, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>7.3 Risk Disclosures Relating to the Lockbox.</p>
            <p>7.3.1 At no point will Blockchain ever take custody or control over any Virtual Currency stored using a Lockbox, nor will we have access to any credentials associated with your Lockbox or the ability to recover any Virtual Currency used in connection with a Lockbox.</p>
            <p>7.3.2 Information relating to Virtual Currency, like balances, availability or value, may not reflect the actual balance in real-time. You must independently verify all information before relying on it, and any decisions or actions taken based upon such information are your sole responsibility.</p>
            <p>7.4 Disclaimer of Warranties.</p>
            <p>7.4.1 Any Services offered in connection with the Lockbox are provided on an "AS IS" basis without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement.</p>
            <p>7.4.2 We make no warranty that any Lockbox will be free from viruses, malware, or other related harmful material and make no representation that your ability to access any Lockbox will be uninterrupted. Any defects or malfunction in the product should be directed to the third party offering the Lockbox and not Blockchain. We shall not be responsible or liable to you for any loss of any kind, from action taken, or taken in reliance on material, or information, contained on or through the Lockbox.</p>
            <div class="text-title">

            <p>8.2.3 Limited Supply. An offer to receive Virtual Currency in an Airdrop is only available to you while supplies last. Once the amount of Virtual Currency offered by Blockchain in an Airdrop is exhausted, any party who has either been placed on a waitlist, or has completed certain additional steps, but not yet received notice of award of Virtual Currency in such Airdrop, shall no longer be eligible to receive Virtual Currency in that Airdrop.

              <p> <strong>“Cryptoexchange” is a legal entity, authorized to perform activity of cryptoplatform operator in the meaning of Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.8 “On development of digital economy” dated December 21, 2017</strong></p><br />
              <p>Currency Com Bel LLC warns the clients about the following risks:</p><br />
              <p>1. digital signs (tokens) (hereinafter referred to as “tokens”) are not legal tender and are not required to be accepted as a means of payment;</p>
              <p>2. the Republic of Belarus, its administrative and territorial units, the Supervisory Board of the High Technologies Park and the administration of the High Technologies Park are not liable to token owners for their technical and legal properties, both as declared during their creation and placement and necessary for token owners to achieve the goals they set when acquiring tokens;</p>
              <p>3. tokens are not provided by the state;</p>
              <p>4. acquisition of tokens may lead to complete loss of funds and other objects of civil rights (investments) transferred in exchange for tokens (including as a result of token cost volatility; technical failures (errors); illegal actions, including theft);</p>
              <p>5. the technology of the register of transaction blocks (blockchain), other distributed information system and similar technologies are innovative and constantly updated, which implies the need for periodic updates (periodic improvement) of the information system of Currency Com Bel LLC and the risk of technical failures (errors) in its operation;</p>
              <p>6. certain tokens sold by Currency Com Bel LLC may be of value only when using the information system of Currency Com Bel LLC and (or) the services rendered by Currency Com Bel LLC;</p>
              <p>7. as the attitude of different states (their regulators) to token transactions (operations) and approaches to their legal regulation differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there is a risk that contracts between Currency Com Bel LLC and its clients or their particular terms and conditions may be invalid and (or) unenforceable in certain states.</p>
